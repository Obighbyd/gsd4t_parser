Samsung Galaxy S2 uses <A HREF="http://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/wiki/GSD4t">GSD4t</A> GPS chipset,
which does not use regular SiRF binary protocol, but some new variant, which is not yet supported by gpsd 
(as of 2014-06-22 gpsd v.3.10+dev3~d6b65b48-1)

The aim of this project is to create helpful scripts and instructions to help reverse engineer the new protocol, 
and make a converter to regular SiRF binary protocol (or NMEA).

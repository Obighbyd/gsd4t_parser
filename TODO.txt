- finish parsing 50bps data (to look for Ephemeris data)

- why does 50BPS data (both in raw GSD4t data from strace.log, and more
  importantly from Samsung-generated SLCLog.gp2 MID 08) seems broken most of
  the time (TLM is invalid, parity does not verify etc)?

- if we had ephemeris (either from 50BPS data, or downloaded from Internet
  AGPS way), what else would we need to calculate satellite pseudorange?
  The time of transmission? Find where that can be acquired from (first from 
  raw GPS communication - 50BPS data or something else?), and then try to find
  it SLCLog.gp2 and finally in raw GSD4t datastream.

- when we have calculated SV pseudoranges, we can proceed to trilaterate our
  position in ECEF, and from there convert to WGS84 lat/lon/height coordinates.

- find what other unknown bits mean and if they can be used for better
  precision, faster fix etc.

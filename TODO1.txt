- The GSD4t is a tracker. The GPS function is split between it and the host processor-based GPS software.
The GSD4t tracker portion of the software provides GPS status, range measurements and demodulated GPS
satellite data to the host-based software.
The GPS software running on the host provides commands and initialization data to the GSD4t and GPS navigation
data at a 1Hz output rate to the user host software.
